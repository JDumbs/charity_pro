            <p>Let me introduce you to the M1 Abrams a third-generation American main battle tank designed by Chrysler Defense (now General Dynamics Land Systems) and named for General Creighton Abrams. Conceived for modern armored ground warfare and now one of the heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 short tons, <strong>aka the soloution.</strong></p>

        <div id = explain>
            <p>The abrams has already proved that it is good for the defense of our country. Why would you not trust it in your on personal defense? Bottom line is that if everyone had a tank they would be well protected from harm physicaly and mentaly. the tanks are large enough to keep people distant and safe from physical harm and what words will harm you that you cant respond with "well I have a tank so Ha!". To add to all of this tanks are large enough that you could live inside it homelessness solved!</p>
